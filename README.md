## Elevator Pitch

devsculture.com is all about developers. It's all about learning. It was built by a junior developer to facilitate access to resources and ideas. It's much more than a database of the different dev tools out there. It showcases each of them and lets you pick and choose, all over a friendly, fast and intuitive responsive design.
